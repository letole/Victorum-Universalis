 bogomilist_new_religion_desc: "Bogomilism is a Christian Neo-Gnostic sect founded during First Bulgarian Empire by the priest Bogomil. The Bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching, rejecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This allowed Bogomilism to spread quickly though Balkans, evantually leaving boundries of Bulgaria and Byzantine Empire. The Bogomils were dualists or Gnostics in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body. They did not use the Christian cross, nor build churches, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing. In 1444 Bogomilist heresy has been erradicated from Bosnia and is only present in few areas of Hum and Bosnia."

 miaphysite_religion_desc: "Miaphysitism is the Christian religious doctrine upheld by many Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Rather than using the wording established at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) that Jesus is one person in two natures, a divine nature and a human nature, they hold that Jesus, the Incarnate Word, is fully divine and fully human, in one physis. By 1444, despite many Turkish invasions, the religion is still present in Eastern Anatolia and Armenia."
